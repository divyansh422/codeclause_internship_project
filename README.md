Project 1 (Image Recognition with OpenCv) and Project 2 (Facial Recognition System)


Project 1 - Image Recognition with OpenCv

Requirements: 
Libraries Required: opencv, opencv-python, matplotlib
Pretrained DL model weights (from the files uploaded): ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt , frozen_inference_graph.pb

Please download all files of both the projects on your local folder. To test your own photos and videos, download them in the same location as the .ipynb file. Also keep rest of the files in the same folder as the .ipynb file.

Project 2 - Facial Recognition System

Requirements:

Libraries required : opencv-python, face_recognition
Files required (uploaded here) : simple_facerec.py, face_recognition.ipynb

1. Create a folder named 'encoding_images' and keep the folder in the same directory as this ipynb file.

2. Select a sample photo of a person for the algorithm to learn from, and place the photo in the 'encoding_images' folder before running the cells in the .ipynb file. For clarity purposes,    name the photo file as the name of the person

3. Press 'esc' to end the live video stream after it has begun

4. The code will be able to recognize the person in the live video stream if it finds their photo in the 'encoding_images' folderÂ¶
